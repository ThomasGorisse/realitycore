/**
 * ### A container that holds the collection of entities rendered by an AR view.
 *
 * You don't create a `Scene` instance directly.
 * Instead, you get the one and only scene associated with a view from the [ARView.Scene] property of an [ARView] instance.
 * ```
 * ARView {
 *      Scene [
 *          AnchorEntity [
 *              Entity [
 *                  Entity,
 *                  Entity
 *              ],
 *              Entity
 *          ],
 *          AnchorEntity [
 *              Entity
 *          ]
 *      ]
 * }
 * ```
 * To add content to the view's scene, you first create and add one or more [AnchorEntity] instances to the [Scene.anchors] collection.
 * Anchors tell RealityCore how to pin virtual content to real world objects, like flat surfaces or images.
 * You then add a hierarchy of other [Entity] instances to each anchor to indicate the geometry and behaviors that RealityCore should render at a given anchor point.
